Here we will outline the analysis of the power spectrum.
I need to do the following steps:

1. Generate the average power spectra for the 800 parcellations
2. Load all the subjects 800 parcellation power spectra
3. For each parcellation, compute distances between participants
4. For each pacellation, compute MDMR from distances
5. Transform ROI vector to be voxelwise and save
